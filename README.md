# Job-Hunter-Pro!

## Description 
Welcome to Job Hunter Pro.
We created this app to allow newly graduated bootcamp students to not only find desired job vacancies to a specific area, but also to compare the job's required skills with the graduates own so that they can see what they need to work on.
The intention of this project was to make finding a job after completing a skills bootcamp, easy and seamless, with guidance on how one can self improve, as we acknowledge finding a job after this bootcamp to be a problem we will all have to resolve post-bootcamp. On this project we learnt how to work as a team, navigating time zone issues and team member absences, we came together for the decision-making to ensure everyone was aligned, and we were able to troubleshoot arising issues together.


## User Story

As a bootcamp graduate, I want to find a new job, using an app to check and choose the jobs that I like and compare skills. If I don't have enough skills, I want to create a list of skills I need to improve and see my progress.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out?
